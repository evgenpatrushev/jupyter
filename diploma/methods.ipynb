    "### Per‐pixel classification approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional per‐pixel classifiers typically develop a signature by combining the spectra of all training‐set pixels for a given feature. The resulting signature contains the contributions of all materials present in the training pixels, but ignores the impact of the mixed pixels. Per‐pixel classification algorithms can be **parametric** or **non‐parametric**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parametric classifiers assume that a normally distributed dataset exists, and that the statistical parameters (e.g. mean vector and covariance matrix) generated from the training samples are representative. However, the assumption of **normal spectral distribution** is often violated, especially in complex landscapes. In addition, insufficient, non‐representative, or multimode distributed training samples can further introduce uncertainty to the image classification procedure. Another major drawback of the parametric classifiers lies in the difficulty of integrating spectral data with ancillary data. [**The maximum likelihood**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation) may be the most commonly used parametric classifier in practice, because of its robustness and its easy availability in almost any image‐processing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "With non‐parametric classifiers, the assumption of a normal distribution of the dataset is not required. No statistical parameters are needed to separate image classes. Non‐parametric classifiers are thus especially suitable for the incorporation of **non‐spectral data** into a classification procedure. Much previous research has indicated that non‐parametric classifiers may provide better classification results than parametric classifiers in complex landscapes. [**The neural network**](https://towardsdatascience.com/wtf-is-image-classification-8e78a8235acb) has several advantages, including its non‐parametric nature, arbitrary decision boundary capability, easy adaptation to different types of data and input structures, fuzzy output values, and generalization for use with multiple images, making it a promising technique for land‐cover classification.\n",

    "### Subpixel classification approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Most classification approaches are based on per‐pixel information, in which each pixel is classified into one category and the land‐cover classes are mutually exclusive. The presence of mixed pixels has been recognized as a major problem, affecting the effective use of remotely sensed data in per‐pixel classifications. Subpixel classification approaches have been developed to provide a more appropriate representation and accurate area estimation of land covers than per‐pixel approaches, especially when coarse spatial resolution data are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**SMA**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/spectral-mixture-analysis) has long been recognized as an effective method for dealing with the mixed pixel problem. It evaluates each pixel spectrum as a linear combination of a set of endmember spectra. The output of SMA is typically presented in the form of fraction images, with one image for each endmember spectrum, representing the area proportions of the endmembers within the pixel. Endmember selection is one of the most important aspects in SMA, and much previous research has explored the approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Per‐field classification approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "The heterogeneity in complex landscapes results in high spectral variation within the same land‐cover class. With per‐pixel classifiers, each pixel is individually grouped into a certain category, and the results may be noisy due to high spatial frequency in the landscape. The per‐field classifier is designed to deal with the problem of environmental heterogeneity, and has shown to be effective for improving classification accuracy. The per‐field classifier averages out the noise by using land parcels as individual units.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geographical information systems (GIS)** provide a means for implementing per‐field classification through integration of vector and raster data. The vector data are used to subdivide an image into parcels, and classification is then conducted based on the **parcels**, thus avoiding intraclass spectral variations. However, per‐field classifications are often affected by such factors as the spectral and spatial properties of remotely sensed data, the size and shape of the fields, the definition of field boundaries, and the land‐cover classes chosen. \n",
    "The difficulty in handling the **dichotomy between vector and raster data models** affects the extensive use of the per‐field classification approach. Remotely sensed data are acquired in raster format, which represents regularly shaped patches of the Earth's surface, while most GIS data are stored in vector format, representing geographical objects with points, lines and polygons.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternate approach is to use an [**object‐oriented classification**](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog883/node/523), which does not require the use of GIS vector data. Two stages are involved in an object‐oriented classification: image segmentation and classification. Image segmentation merges pixels into objects, and a classification is then implemented based on objects, instead of individual pixels.\n",

    "### Contextual classification approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual classification exploits spatial information among neighbouring pixels to improve classification results.\n",
    "A contextual classifier may use smoothing techniques, Markov random fields, spatial statistics, fuzzy logic, segmentation, or neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### A summary of classification approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Although many classification approaches have been developed, which approach is suitable for features of interest in a given study area is not fully understood. Classification algorithms can be **per‐pixel, subpixel, and per‐field**. Per‐pixel classification is still most commonly used in practice. However, the accuracy may not meet the requirement of research because of the impact of the **mixed pixel problem**. Subpixel algorithms have the potential to deal with the mixed pixel problem, and may achieve higher accuracy for medium and coarse spatial resolution images. For fine spatial resolution data, although mixed pixels are reduced, the spectral variation within land classes may decrease the classification accuracy. Per‐field classification approaches are most suitable for fine spatial resolution data. When using multisource data, such as a combination of spectral signatures, texture and context information, and ancillary data, advanced non‐parametric classifiers, such as neural network, decision tree, and knowledge‐based classification, may be more suited to handle these complex data processes, and thus have gained increasing attention in the remote‐sensing community in recent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three criteria — **the aim of classification, available computer resources, and effective separation of the classes**. In practice, the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data, use of ancillary data, the classification system, the available software, and the analyst's experience may all affect the decision of selecting a classifier"
