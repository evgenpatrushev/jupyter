"Criteria","Categories","Characteristics","Example of classifiers"
"Whether training samples are used or not","Supervised classification approaches","Land cover classes are defined. Sufficient reference data are available and used as training samples. The signatures generated from the training samples are then used to train the classifier to classify the spectral data into a thematic map.","Maximum likelihood, minimum distance, artificial neural network, decision tree classifier."
 , "Unsupervised classification approaches","Clustering‐based algorithms are used to partition the spectral image into a number of spectral classes based on the statistical information inherent in the image. No prior definitions of the classes are used. The analyst is responsible for labelling and merging the spectral classes into meaningful classes.","ISODATA, K‐means clustering algorithm."
"Whether parameters such as mean vector and covariance matrix are used or not","Parametric classifiers","Gaussian distribution is assumed. The parameters (e.g. mean vector and covariance matrix) are often generated from training samples. When landscape is complex, parametric classifiers often produce ‘noisy’ results. Another major drawback is that it is difficult to integrate ancillary data, spatial and contextual attributes, and non‐statistical information into a classification procedure.","Maximum likelihood, linear discriminant analysis."
 , "Non‐parametric classifiers","No assumption about the data is required. Non‐parametric classifiers do not employ statistical parameters to calculate class separation and are especially suitable for incorporation of non‐remote‐sensing data into a classification procedure.","Artificial neural network, decision tree classifier, evidential reasoning, support vector machine, expert system."
"Which kind of pixel information is used","Per‐pixel classifiers","Traditional classifiers typically develop a signature by combining the spectra of all training‐set pixels from a given feature. The resulting signature contains the contributions of all materials present in the training‐set pixels, ignoring the mixed pixel problems.","Most of the classifiers, such as maximum likelihood, minimum distance, artificial neural network, decision tree, and support vector machine."
 , "Subpixel classifiers","The spectral value of each pixel is assumed to be a linear or non‐linear combination of defined pure materials (or endmembers), providing proportional membership of each pixel to each endmember.","Fuzzy‐set classifiers, subpixel classifier, spectral mixture analysis."
"Which kind of pixel information is used","Object‐oriented classifiers","Image segmentation merges pixels into objects and classification is conducted based on the objects, instead of an individual pixel. No GIS vector data are used.","eCognition."
 , "Per‐field classifiers","GIS plays an important role in per‐field classification, integrating raster and vector data in a classification. The vector data are often used to subdivide an image into parcels, and classification is based on the parcels, avoiding the spectral variation inherent in the same class.","GIS‐based classification approaches."
"Whether output is a definitive decision about land cover class or not","Hard classification","Making a definitive decision about the land cover class that each pixel is allocated to a single class. The area estimation by hard classification may produce large errors, especially from coarse spatial resolution data due to the mixed pixel problem.","Most of the classifiers, such as maximum likelihood, minimum distance, artificial neural network, decision tree, and support vector machine."
 , "Soft (fuzzy) classification","Providing for each pixel a measure of the degree of similarity for every class. Soft classification provides more information and potentially a more accurate result, especially for coarse spatial resolution data classification.","Fuzzy‐set classifiers, subpixel classifier, spectral mixture analysis."
"Whether spatial information is used or not","Spectral classifiers","Pure spectral information is used in image classification. A ‘noisy’ classification result is often produced due to the high variation in the spatial distribution of the same class.","Maximum likelihood, minimum distance, artificial neural network."
 , "Contextual classifiers","The spatially neighbouring pixel information is used in image classification.","Iterated conditional modes, point‐to‐point contextual correction, frequency‐based contextual classifier."
 , "Spectral‐contextual classifiers","Spectral and spatial information is used in classification. Parametric or non‐parametric classifiers are used to generate initial classification images and then contextual classifiers are implemented in the classified images.","ECHO, combination of parametric or non‐parametric and contextual algorithms."
